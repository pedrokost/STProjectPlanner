## Plan: Information

Last updated: 2016-05-08

There are errors in your plan:

*Past deadline*:
- "[Prepare for biology midterm](https://trello.com/c/oaf76ars/23-prepare-for-biology-midterm)" (Bio) should have been completed by 2016-03-02
- "Study for exam for linear algebra" (Math) should have been completed by 2016-04-01

*Prerequirement mismatch*:
- Bio: "Read biology book" should have been completed before - [Prepare for biology midterm](https://trello.com/c/oaf76ars/23-prepare-for-biology-midterm) [Bio 1w 2016-03-02]. Instead it will be done by 2016-05-09
- Math: "Learn calculus" should have been completed before - Study for exam for calculus [Math 3d 2016-12-17]. Instead it will be done by 2017-01-12
- Math: "Learn linear algebra" should have been completed before - Study for exam for linear algebra [Math 1w 2016-04-01]. Instead it will be done by 2017-01-24

*Incorrect ordering of tasks with deadline*:
- School stuff: Task *Study for exam for calculus* with deadline 2016-12-17 should be placed after task *Study for exam for linear algebra* with deadline 2016-04-01
